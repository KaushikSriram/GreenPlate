# GreenPlate
Introduction

GreenPlate is an app that allows individuals to track their eating and shopping habits, in order to promote sustainability and a healthy lifestyle. Through GreenPlate, users have the ability to keep track of calorie intake, find new recipes, manage ingredients, and create shopping lists. The data visualization functionality empowers individuals to understand their dietary habits with an intuitive interface. Further, users can create their own accounts to interact with the interface in a secure and reliable manner. This comprehensive project was implemented across the course of four sprints, each introducing additional functionality to provide users with the best experience possible!
