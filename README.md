# GreenPlate
Introduction

GreenPlate is an app that allows individuals to track their eating and shopping habits, in order to promote sustainability and a healthy lifestyle. Through GreenPlate, users have the ability to keep track of calorie intake, find new recipes, manage ingredients, and create shopping lists. The data visualization functionality empowers individuals to understand their dietary habits with an intuitive interface. Further, users can create their own accounts to interact with the interface in a secure and reliable manner. This comprehensive project was implemented across the course of four sprints, each introducing additional functionality to provide users with the best experience possible! Keep scrolling to learn a little bit more about the various aspects of our project, including the design & architecture, user interface (UI), functionality, and some reflections looking back on the past semester.

Design & Architecture

Throughout the course of this project, we utilized various Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to visualize the functionality of our project in an intuitive way. Two primary UML diagrams we utilized were Sequence Diagrams (SD) and Design Class Diagrams (DCD). As we navigated the creation of the app, we periodically outlined specific use cases with a lot of moving parts and developed the design framework to simplify the software development process for these instances. Below are some examples of this method in action!

Sequence Diagram (SD)

User Case: If the user enters valid ingredient information and hits the submit button, the system will store this ingredient to their pantry and it will be displayed on the ingredient screen.

Design Class Diagram (DCD)

User Case: An existing Greenplate user logs into the app and attempts to add an ingredient to their pantry. This opens the form entry for adding an ingredient. The user enters the ingredient information and clicks the button to submit the new ingredient. They are directed back to the ingredient page after clicking the back button. There the new ingredient is displayed in the ingredient list.
